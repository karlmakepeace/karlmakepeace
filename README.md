### Hi there 👋

#### My name is Karl Makepeace and I am proteomics scientist currently based in Victoria, B.C., Canada

- 🌎 Originally from northern British Columbia, Canada 🍁
- 🎓 Ph.D. Biochemistry w/ focus on mass spectrometry-based proteomics ✨📊
- 💻 Previously at [University of Victoria-Genome B.C. Proteomics Centre](https://www.proteincentre.com/) as a Bioinformatician 👨‍💻 and a Research Technician 👨‍🔬
- 🔍 Looking for employment opportunities (industry or academic) that require a combination of mass spec., proteo(genom)ic, and bioinformatic skillsets.

#### My research focus and interests:
- 💻 bioinformatics and programming
- 🧩 protein structure and structural proteomics
- 🔗 protein-protein interaction networks
- 🧬 genetic variants and proteogenomic analyses
- ⚙️ workflow/toolchain/method development

👨‍💻 I code primarily in R and VB(A)


<!--
- 🌱 My current goal is to complete a proteogenomic-focused R package and make it available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) (or [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/))
